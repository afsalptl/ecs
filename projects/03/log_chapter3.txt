Sequential Logic
----------------

Clock
-----

clock signal is represented using "tick" (starts low phase) and "tock" (starts high phase)

The elapsed time between beginning of a "tick" and the end of subsequent "tock" is called 'cycle' - one discrete time unit.
ie cycle == a pair of tick and tock (or) low and high signals

each time unit consist of 2 phases.
1)	A 'tick' ends the first phase of a time unit and starts its second phase
	so tick ends the high phase and starts low phase
2)	A 'tock' ends the second phase of time unit & signals first phase of he next time unit
	so tock starts the high phase of next time unit

nth cycle is represented as tock n followed by tick n+
			 tock  tick
So cycle 0 	-	-	0+
   cycle 1	-	1	1+
   cycle 2	-	2 	2+
   cycle 3	-	3	3+
   ..................

	0+	1	1+	2	2+	3	3+	4	4+	5	5+  
	    ___ 	___ 	___  	___ 	___ 	
	   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |
	___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|   |___|


	tick|tock|tick|tock|...

DFF (Data Flipflop)
-------------------
	 _________
	|         |
  --| D       |-- Q
	|         |
	|         |
	|>        |-- !Q
	|_________|

Characteristic Table

	D 	Q 	Q+	
	0	0	0	RST
	0	1	0	RST
	1	0	1	SET
	1	1	1	SET

DFF simply outputs the input value from the previous time unit
Out(t) = In(t-1)

when the clock is not at a positive edge . the DFF ignores D,
However at the positive edge,it reads in the value D ,and based on it ,updates Q
Simply say,it takes the value of D.

Bit(Binary Cell) & Register
---------------------------
are storage devices that can store or remember a value over time, ie Out(t) = Out(t-1)

if load(t-1)==1 Out(t) = In(t-1) else Out(t) = Out(t-1)

a 'w' bit register can be constructed from an array of 'w' single Bit registers. 

RAM
---
data width - width of each one of its words	(16)
size	-	number of words in the RAM

RAM8
----
is built from 8 registers

[!!!]in the case of read operation (load=0),the RAM's output immediately emits the value of the selected register.ie time-independent
[!!!]in the case of write operation (load=1),the selected memory register commits to the input value in the next time unit,at which 	point the RAM's output will starts emitting it.

RAM64 	- 8*RAM8
RAM512	- 8*RAM64
RAM4K	- 8*RAM512
RAM16K	- 4*RAM4K

PC
--
Out(t) = Out(t-1) + c

Sequential Chip[NOTE]

Sequential Chips are unstable during clock cycles,they will output correct values at the beginning of next cycle only.

the length of the clock cycle should be slightly longer than that the time it takes a bit to travel the longest distance from one Chip in the architecture to another.

HDL[NOTE]

if Xxx.hdl exists in the current directory
	then load it
else if Xxx.hdl exists in BuiltIn Directory
	then load it
else
	Issue an error message
