2^(2^n) boolean functions can be defined using 'n' binary variables.
ex :-
n=2
2^2 = 4 AND terms can be defined - xy,xy',x'y,x'y'
and ORing of these terms can be done either by selecting or discarding each terms
hence 2 possiblities for each term. - 2*2*2*2 = 16 = 2^(2^2)


15 Fundamental Gates are Implemented
NOT
AND
OR, XOR
MUX, DMUX
NOT16, OR16, AND16
OR8WAY
MUX4WAY16, MUX8WAY16
DMUX4WAY, DMUX8WAY
MUX16

[SOLVED]If done in a group, absolutely need a version tracking tool. Using google Drive is turning out to be a massive headache.

The basic MUX that is in Mux.hdl is a 2-MUX. We can implement a 4x1 MUX using 3 2x1 MUX
Similiarly 8x1 MUX can be implemented using 2 4x1 MUX and 1 2x1 MUX

for passing an array, pass each induvidual elements as if if passing array sel[2] then do sel[0]=value, sel[1]=value
or by sel[0..1] = value array

The individual bits in a bus(array) are indexed 0...w-1, from right to left (i.e., index 0 refers to the least significant bit).

internal pins can't be subscripted.
